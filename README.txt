Hi! Thank you for taking a look at this project. This is a project I did as a part of the full-stack course provided by CodeAcademy. Loose guidelines and examples were given, but the project was largely open ended only requiring that the page be a website style guide. I understand this project is not terribly impressive or technical as it only uses html and css, but it was a good way of becoming more fluent and comfortable with these languages.
